# Limitations
I don't hook the IR service yet, so no zl/zr or c-stick.
However, it is why I started this, so I'll be looking into it.

## Credits
Memory patching code taken from BootNTR

Steveice10's buildtools used to build input_proc

Shinyquagsire for his writeup on redirecting input over WiFi.

Stary & Kazo for InputRedirector, upon which almost all of this is based.

## How to Use
Install the ButtonSwapNTR cia on your 3ds.

Not really configurable right now, but can be changed if you know ASM.
